        <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (1892–1973) was a major scholar of the English language, specialising in Old and Middle English.<br> Twice Professor of Anglo-Saxon (Old English) at the University of Oxford, he also wrote a number of stories, including most<br> famously The Hobbit (1937) and The Lord of the Rings (1954–1955), which are set in a pre-historic era in an invented version<br> of our world which he called by the Middle English name of Middle-earth. This was peopled by Men (and women), Elves, Dwarves,<br> Trolls, Orcs (or Goblins) and of course Hobbits. He has regularly been condemned by the Eng. Lit. establishment, with<br> honourable exceptions, but loved by literally millions of readers worldwide.</p>
